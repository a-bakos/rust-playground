Genuinely Funny US Sitcom
A surprisingly funny series in a sea of poor US sitcoms. A good overarching plot to give the wider context progress, supplemented by individual characters developing in their own arcs. The characters are all unique and often lie on stereotypes, and for the most part likeable.
The series makes frequent references to each season's year in US culture which is a brilliant addition, but may have far less of an impact when watched in years to come. This supports a dialogue and situational comedy which is genuinely funny, causing actual laughs rather than just exhaling through the nose at punchlines. Difficult to praise a US sitcom any higher than saying it's actually funny, when there are so many that fail.
